# Project details
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project, you will use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

# PROJECT SPECIFICATION
## Code Quality
All code cells can be run without error.

Tips: Implement safeguards against invalid user inputs that can potentially break the codes. Please refer to the “Solicit and handle raw user input” rubric item for further details.


1- Appropriate data types (e.g. strings, floats) and data structures (e.g. lists, dictionaries) are chosen to carry out the required analysis tasks.


2- Loops and conditional statements are used to process the data correctly.


3- Packages are used to carry out advanced tasks.



4- Functions are used to reduce repetitive code.


5- Docstrings, comments, and variable names enable the readability of the code.

## Script and Questions

1- Raw input is solicited and handled correctly to guide the interactive question-answering experience; no errors are thrown when unexpected input is entered.

2- User inputs should be made case insensitive, which means the input should accept the string of "Chicago" and its case variants, such as "chicago", "CHICAGO", or "cHicAgo".

3- You should also implement error handlings so your program does not throw any errors due to invalid inputs. For example, if the user enters "Los Angeles" for the city, the error handling should reject the user input and avoid breaking the codes.

4- Descriptive statistics are correctly computed and used to answer the questions posed about the data.

5- Raw data is displayed upon request by the user in the following manner:

6- Your script should prompt the user if they want to see 5 lines of raw data,
Display that data if the answer is 'yes',
Continue iterating these prompts and displaying the next 5 lines of raw data at each iteration,
Stop the program when the user says 'no' or there is no more raw data to display.
